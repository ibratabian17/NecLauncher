# Nectar Launcher

Nectar Launcher is an Android launcher based on webview technology, designed to be cross-platform. It utilizes Electron for Linux, Windows, and macOS, and it has a dedicated application for Android. Compilation for Android can be done within the 'android' folder using the command `cd`.

Please note that the Electron implementation is still a work in progress and not fully functional at this stage. This project is in its early development phase, and not all features have been implemented yet.
